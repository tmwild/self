            <h5>Box it</h5>
            <p>Use facts, reason, truth, and logic to calm the Chimp down.</p>
            <p>It may take several episodes of exercising the Chimp for any one problem before you can box it. You may also need to keep putting the Chimp back into its box several times for any one problem.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, the Chimp does not need to be exercised and will go into the box of logic and truth straight away.</p>

            <h5>Exercise it</h5>
            <p>Take the Chimp out to an appropriate place, let it all out, listen to the chimp for as long as it takes. Don't comment</p>

            <h5>Give it a banana</h5>
            <p>A way to distract the Chimp. It could be external praise or approval.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you can skip directly to boxing the Chimp without exercising it.</p>
