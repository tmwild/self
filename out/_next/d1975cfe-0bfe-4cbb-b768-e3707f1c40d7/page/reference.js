You may also need to keep putting the Chimp back into its box several times for any one problem.</p><p> Sometimes, the Chimp does not need to be exercised and will go into the box of logic and truth straight away.</p><h3> Distract Chimp with Banana</h3><p> a way to distract the Chimp.

You cannot remove them, but you can contain them.</p><p> Gremlins are softwired and can be removed, usually have to do with unhelpful and unrealistic expectation.</p><p> E.g. of Goblin, a child who thinks that her worth is based on what she achieves.</p><p> E.g. of Gremlin, I believe that I should always be on time.</p><p> Autopilots and Gremlins are put into the Computer by your Human and your Chimp respectively.</p><p> When a situation occurs, both your Human and your Chimp will look to the Computer for references.

To discover the Life force, imagine you are on your death bed and you have one minute left. Your great-great-grandchild asks, "What should i do with my life?" Your answer is your Life Force.</p><p> Your Computer provides a reference for a Mindset. A Mindset is based on perception of self, other people, and the world.</p><p> Humans don\'t always get it right. Chimps don\'t always get it wrong.</p><p> You can search out and replace Gremlins with Autopilots.</p><p> The Stone of Life is the most important part of your mind. It is something that you can work on.</p><p> Reinforcing the Stone of Life by making it visible every day is a major settling influence on you.</p><p> You can replace the "Should" Gremlins with the "Could" Autopilots. This needs to be done repeatedly to embed the Autopilots into the Computer so that it can work without your inputs.</p><p> <strong> I cannot urge you enough to return to your Stone of Life and if necessary perfect and redraw your poster. </strong> When you get this clear in your mind, it will be the most settling influence on your Chimp, your Human and your very existence.
