These are two very different approaches.</p><p> All info goes to Chimp first, Human second.</p><p> INFO ---&gt; Chimp ---&gt; Human</p><p> Willpower is NOT a good way to manage your Chimp. Your Chimp is 5x stronger than your Human. You cannot control your Chimp, but you can manage it.</p><p> Part of the problem of clashes between your Chimp and you is not realizing that the Chimp is merely making an <strong>offer</strong>, not a command. You have a choice to accept or reject the offer.</p><p> INPUT ---&gt; Chimp (interprets emotionally) ---&gt;gives an offer to ---&gt; Human (who has a choice to accept or reject)</p><p> You are responsible for managing your Chimp and its actions just like you are responsible for your dog and its actions. You cannot change the nature of the Chimp but you can manage its actions.</p><p> Two aspects to working with the Chimp: first nurture, then manage.</p><h2> Manage the Chimp</h2><p> Three ways to manage your Chimp:</p><ol> <li> Exercise </li><li> Box </li><li> Banana </li></ol><h3> Exercise The Chimp</h3><ol> <li> Take the Chimp out to a locked compounds </li><li> Let it all out </li><li> Listen to the Chimp for as long as it takes. </li><li> Don't comment </li></ol><h3> Boxing the Chimp</h3><p> Use facts, reason, truth, and logic to calm the Chimp down.</p><p> It may take several episodes of exercising the Chimp for any one problem before you can box it. You may also need to keep putting the Chimp back into its box several times for any one problem.</p><p> Sometimes, the Chimp does not need to be exercised and will go into the box of logic and truth straight away.</p><h3> Distract Chimp with Banana</h3><p> a way to distract the Chimp. It could be external praise or approval.</p><p> Sometimes you can skip directly to boxing the Chimp without exercising it.</p><h2> Exercise you can use</h2><p> One good exercise is NEAT.</p><p> It is <strong>Normal</strong> to have Chimp outbursts and activity that you will not manage well.</p><p> Therefore you should <strong>Expect</strong> this to happen from time to time.</p><p> <strong>Accept</strong> that you are not perfect and this animal is powerful.</p><p> <strong>Take care of</strong> the outburst or activity by appropriate means, apologies if you have affected others, forgiveness if you feel guilty.</p></div></div></div><div class="card mt-2"><div class="card-header" id="heading-The-Guiding-Moon"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse-The-Guiding-Moon" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-The-Guiding-Moon">3: The Guiding Moon</button></h5></div><div id="collapse-The-Guiding-Moon" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading-The-Guiding-Moon" data-parent="#chapters"><div class="card-body"><p> Your Computer (Parietal) has two functions:</p><ol> <li> Think and act automatically for you using programmed thoughts and behaviors. </li><li> Reference source for information, beliefs, and values. </li></ol><p> Your Computer is 20x faster than your Human.</p><p> Your Computer has 5 parts:</p><ol> <li> Autopilots </li><li> Goblins </li><li> Gremlins </li><li> Stone of Life </li><li> Mindset </li></ol><p> Autopilots are positive, constructive beliefs, behaviors, and automatic functioning.</p><p> E.g., riding a bicycle, staying calm when something goes wrong, focuses on solutions than problems.</p><p> Goblins and Gremlins are the opposite of Autopilots.</p><p> Goblins are hardwired in your Computer because they were put there when you were very young. You cannot remove them, but you can contain them.</p><p> Gremlins are softwired and can be removed, usually have to do with unhelpful and unrealistic expectation.</p><p> E.g. of Goblin, a child who thinks that her worth is based on what she achieves.</p><p> E.g. of Gremlin, I believe that I should always be on time.</p><p> Autopilots and Gremlins are put into the Computer by your Human and your Chimp respectively.</p><p> When a situation occurs, both your Human and your Chimp will look to the Computer for references. The Human will find Autopilots and the Chimp will retrieve Gremlins.</p><p> It is important to have lots of Autopilots in the Computer because this will help to slow down the Chimp.</p><h2> The Stone of Life</h2><p> Stone of Life contains 3 smaller components:</p><ol> <li> Truths of Life </li><li> Values </li><li> Life force </li></ol><p> Truths of life are the set of beliefs that you know how the world works and you can "prove" they are true by experience or example.</p><p> Values are beliefs you have found to be important to you.</p><p> Truths are evidence based, Values are personal judgement calls.</p><p> The Life Force is what you believe life is about and how you should live it. To discover the Life force, imagine you are on your death bed and you have one minute left. Your great-great-grandchild asks, "What should i do with my life?" Your answer is your Life Force.</p><p> Your Computer provides a reference for a Mindset. A Mindset is based on perception of self, other people, and the world.</p><p> Humans don't always get it right. Chimps don't always get it wrong.</p><p> You can search out and replace Gremlins with Autopilots.</p><p> The Stone of Life is the most important part of your mind. It is something that you can work on.</p><p> Reinforcing the Stone of Life by making it visible every day is a major settling influence on you.</p><p> You can replace the "Should" Gremlins with the "Could" Autopilots. This needs to be done repeatedly to embed the Autopilots into the Computer so that it can work without your inputs.</p><p> <strong> I cannot urge you enough to return to your Stone of Life and if necessary perfect and redraw your poster. </strong> When you get this clear in your mind, it will be the most settling influence on your Chimp, your Human and your very existence. Remember that <strong> the Stone of Life is by far the most powerful stabilizer for your Psychological Mind and the indeed for your entire Universe. </strong></p><h2> <strong>How you can change your default programme</strong></h2><h2></h2><p> 3 ways to change your programme:</p><ol> <li> Human intervenes by managing Chimp to stop acting out its thoughts </li><li> Getting the help of others </li><li> using the Computer to manage the Chimp </li></ol><p> Chimp:</p><p> Event -&gt; Feelings/Impression -&gt;Emotional Thinking -&gt; Plan -&gt; Action</p><p> Human: <br/> Event -&gt; Facts/Truth -&gt; Logical Thinking -&gt; Plan -&gt; Action</p><p> You cannot stop Chimp from reacting to the event, but you can stop the Chimp from acting on the reactions.</p><p> Chimp:</p><p> Event -&gt; Feelings/Impression -&gt; Intervention HERE!! Switch to Human track</p><p> Human: <br/> Facts/Truth -&gt; Logical Thinking -&gt; Plan -&gt; Action</p><p> You cannot always use the Human to intervene successfully because the Chimp is strongest and reacts faster than Human.</p><p> However, the Chimp will check with the Computer for reference, so you can programme the Computer to settle the Chimp down.</p><p> Your personality is a mixture of Chimp, Human and Computer.</p><p> You can be the person you want to be, but your Chimp hijacks your being.</p></div></div></div><div class="card mt-2"><div class="card-header" id="heading-The-Planet-of-Others"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link collapsed" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse-The-Planet-of-Others" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse-The-Planet-of-Others">4: The Planet of Others</button></h5></div><div id="collapse-The-Planet-of-Others" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading-The-Planet-of-Others" data-parent="#chapters"><div class="card-body"><h2> Snow White Mindset</h2><p> Innocent, passive victim at the mercy of others and circumstances.

A goal is something totally within your control. </p><p> Dreams send blood supply to the Chimp. </p><p> Goals send blood supply to the Human. </p><p> Don't make dreams into goals because you will set the Chimp off. </p><p> Psychological evidence shows that we need to dream big and set challenging goals to excite ourselves and stretch our abilities. </p><p> Aim for the stars not the moon. </p><p> Stars are goals you can achieve with great effort </p><p> Moon is a goal you can achieve with effort. </p><h4> Foundation Stones </h4> <p> Foundation stones are components the Dream rests on. Basically they are still goals with measurable outcomes. </p><p> Some are target goals. Others are maintenance goals. Always work on 1 or 2 target goals at a time. </p><p> Maintenance goals are goals where you only need to maintain the standards of your outcomes. Target goals are those with standards just a little out of reach. </p><h4> Commitment Screen </h4> <p> Make a list of essential, significant and desirable needs to reach your dream. </p><p> Make a list of hurdles, barriers and pitfalls that lie between you and your dream. </p><h4> The Plan </h4> <p> THe more preparation you make with your plan, the more likely you are to succeed. </p><p> Make the plan in stages. just like you planned the ascent onto a mountain by planning for different camps along the way up. </p><h4> Oiling the wheels </h4> <p> When you reach a goal (camp), look back. Celebrate how much you have gone so far. </p><p> Monitor the success with a chart or some visible signs of showing your progress. </p><p> Display visible reminders and encouragers such as posters or notes to keep your Chimp on track. </p><p> Get a friend to share your journey with. </p><h4> Audit </h4> <p> Looking at the progress so far. Are you on track? What is working? What isn't? </p><p> Successful thinking requires considering the source of problems in this order: </p><ol> <li> Me </li><li> Circumstances </li><li> Others </li></ol> <p> Chimp thinks </p><ol> <li> Others </li><li> Circumstances </li><li> Me (and not really at all) </li></ol> <p> Sometimes your Chimp will repaint the picture and rationalize your errors into a rosy situation. Don't let your Chimp deceive yourself. </p><h4> Outcomes </h4> <p> Success can lead to 3 feelings: complacency, fear of losing success, emotional depressed because the success did not turn out to be as wonderful as first thought. </p><p> It is normal to have a dive in emotions after success. </p><p> Partial success </p><p> Chimp sees things black and white like a child. Consider that you may have partial success as an outcome rather than success and failures only. </p><p> Failures can be an opportunity to sharpen your skills and problem solving capability.
